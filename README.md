## Description

#### Pizza Parlor

A website for a pizza company$("#recipt").show();
    $("#pizzaOrder").hide();

- user can:
- choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc)
- size to order a pizza
- see the final cost

- Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
- Creates a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
- Creates a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen.

You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like).
The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.
